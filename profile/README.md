# About
Work Group is a collective that brings designers and artists opportunities to collaborate, learn, teach, and connect. 

With a bias towards architecture, visualization, and virtual spaces we work collectively to ideate, produce, and deliver boundary pushing creative work and experiments.

In-person meetups include design charrettes, peer reviews, workshops, and casual conversations about process, tools, life, and practice.

An open source knowledge base is being developed that will feature tutorials, scripts, and practical resources for freelancers. Contract templates, communication standards, and workflow tips will be readily accessible.

Reach out if you have a project in mind, or want to join the discussion.
